# My Library App

Simple Library App made to input author,title,and pages of a book and if you have read it or not status.

Some things I learned from this project,

- Learned to properly use the array.splice when removing a book
- Using DOM to take input forms on submit and pass it over to view on the webpage
- Setting an if/else statement on whether I have checked the readStatus to change
- Removing the array upon targeted book and removing the book off display cell
